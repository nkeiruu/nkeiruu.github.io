I am currently a particle accelerator operator at Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. Here I write about my interests including science, technology, climate and productivity. The science will mostly be physics and the technology - programming. I have strong worldly streak, being an Irish and American dual citizen and having lived on three continents. I have a B.Sc in physics from Stony Brook University and am a proud community college alum.
