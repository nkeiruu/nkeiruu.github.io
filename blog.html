            Writers, professional and amateur, have always fascinated me. 
            I am always amazed how, when given a topic, they can expand and eloquently develop ideas over several paragraphs and pages. 
            Before this class, I was terrified by the blank page. Even if I was passionate about the topic, filling up whole pages daunted me. 
            I just did not know how to develop what I thought. As I wrote, the words began to flow but that initial process, which could take hours, made writing uncomfortable for me. 
            Looking back at my semester's work, I am proud of the volume of work I have produced. I have learnt to give myself a day or two to just think about the brief in the back of my mind before sitting down to write rather than force myself to come up with ideas there and then.
            The most significant essay in this course was the persuasive research essay. From the extensive list of controversial topics provided, I chose to discuss the somewhat taboo topic of prostitution. It was too obvious to argue that prostitution should be illegal as that is what is most people think as our laws reflect. 
            Therefore, I decided to argue it should be legal. It was quite challenging to have a gut feeling that prostitution should be legal but not know how to put it into words.
             On the other hand, I found comfort in organizing my points well and using transitions to make my paper flow.
