        <p>
            It is possible to get a bachelors in physics starting from the community college level.

            Keep these tips in mind.
            If you have A.S Physics, you are set, skip to research section.

            join the larger physics community day one. Help you see the bigger picture, keep you motivated. By the time you transfer, you will be up to speed, might know more than classmates.

            Get physics bachelors syllabus from 2-3 schools you interested in. Ensure a mix of private and public colleges. Put in excel or write on paper. Make sure you are taking similar classes. Bonus if state to state system transfer, then it will be easier to compare and all credits must be accepted.

        
            Let your instructors know that you intend to transfer to physics bachelors. Can help point you to further resources, get connections.

            Get research experiences even as a community college student.
