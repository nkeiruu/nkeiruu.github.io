They are complex structures that require the expertise and effort of many professionals who are not likely to be in the same country. Novel accelerator related techniques are created and shared between researchers all over the world. One-of-a-kind equipment is finds new life in facilities separated by land and sea (Read till end to see example). On the heels of attending some insightful webinars, I highlight some proposed accelerator-based facilities that push beyond the frontiers of science and national borders.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>During the APS FIP webinar entitled “Beating Cancer with SEEIIST while Shaping Science in South-East Europe”, Dr. Sanja Damjanovic (physicist at GSI and former Minister of Science for Montenegro) , defined science diplomacy as science done by many nations. In the case of SEEIST, these countries are Republic of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of Bulgaria, Kosovo*, Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Republic of Serbia and Republic of Slovenia.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>SEEIST notes: ‘This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSC 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence.’&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>SEEIST is a regional research infrastructure institute in southeastern Europe. Since 2017, efforts have been made to envision how SEEIST will collectively achieve goals such as scientific excellence, technology transfer, education and fostering peace through science. After some deliberation, the institute decided it will focus on creating a Hadron Cancer Therapy Centre centered on Biomedical Research with protons and heavy ions. This accelerator-based facility in its design phase but has already garnered national, EU and IAEA support. This project has a lot of promise in promoting international cooperation between countries with thawing relations.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Muons are the heavier siblings of the well-known electron. As I speak, you are probably being showered in muons right now.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They are a product of cosmic rays which hit the earth at a rate of 10,000 particles per square meter per second (for 1GeV particles).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/span>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>With a lifetime of just 2.2 microseconds, the main scientific challenges of harnessing muons in particle accelerators center around accelerating and colliding them before they disappear. The magnets have to be more powerful and the rate at which RF structures accelerate particles have to be higher than ever. However, the challenges would be worth it to achieve record setting collision energies in the 10s of tetra electron-volts (TeV), opening the door to find new physics. On 28 August 2024, young researchers gathered virtually to share their research findings and enthusiasm about the muon collider. (
) The project has brought together countries from UK, Italy, Germany and France. Projects like this continue cooperation between friendly nations, something which should not be taken for granted.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Finally, no conversation about proposed accelerator-based facilities is complete without talking about the African Light Source (AfLS). Envisioned to be first synchrotron on the continent, the inaugural AfLS conference took place in 2015. Since then, the team behind the efforts has organized several efforts towards its realization. Schools and conferences train African scientists on synchrotron-based techniques. The AfLS steering committee works to gather political support from national governments and pan African organizations. A major prong of current work is the Conceptual Design Report which will outline site, infrastructure and staff requirements of the future facility. The seventh AfLS conference will take place online and in Johannesburg from 18-23 November 2024.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These projects have reminded me of the uniquely global effort it takes to build research-scale particle accelerators. It is part of the reason why I continue to be fascinated by this field. Even in my own duties, as an accelerator operator, I am reminded of this:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Science diplomacy not only fosters cooperation between countries with otherwise frosty relations, but it also allows nations to achieve goals that could not reach on their own. Particle accelerator-based facilities are usual vehicles for science diplomacy usually due to high infrastructure and human capacity requirements and it is part of the reason why I enjoy the field!&lt;/p>

Why not start at community college?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Whether you are in secondary school, an adult looking to return to college, or already in community college, this article will give you the inside scoop on how to do it. This article is most relevant to readers in the United States.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-commmunity-college">Why commmunity college?&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>It is cheaper than doing a degree only a 4-year college.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is more accessible to those who need to maintain full or part time jobs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can still access oppurtunities to do physics research through summer internships&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="now-let-me-play-devils-advocate-why-not-commmunity-college">Now let me play devil&amp;rsquo;s advocate. Why not commmunity college?&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Nothing makes more financial sense than a full ride scholarship to a 4-year college.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Harder to get in-semester physics research experiences.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Likely a lack of peers also pursuing physics.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="alright-we-have-both-sides-here-are-some-of-my-recommendations-on-what-to-do-in-community-college-if-you-have-your-eye-on-transferring-into-a-physics-major-in-university">Alright, we have both sides, here are some of my recommendations on what to do in community college if you have your eye on transferring into a physics major in university.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Join the larger physics community on day one. Organizations like the American Physical Society (which supports the National Mentoring Community and the Conference of Women in Physics), the National Society of Black Physicsists, American Association of Physics Teachers, Society of Indigenous Physicists, the American Astronomical Society, the National Society of Hispanic Physicsists and more have student sections which you can join (for free or low cost) no matter where you go to college. Getting involved in the student section of a national organization will help you see the bigger picture and connect with more experienced physicists. It can also keep you motivated in the arduous pursuit of a physics bachelors. By the time you transfer to a 4-year, you will be up to speed to what is going on the physics scene. You might know more than your future classmates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obtain the curriculum of BSc Physics program from 2-3 schools that you are interested in. You can usually find this on a physics department website, by emailing an advisor or asking a current student. Ensure a mix of private and public colleges so you can see what classes are common to many programs. Put this list in a spreadsheet or write it on paper. You can now make sure you are taking relevant freshman or sophomore classes and know what to look forward to when you transfer. Bonus if you transfer within a state public system, then it will be easier to compare and all credits that you take must be accepted (Although there may not always be a one-to-one equivalent). Pro tip: community college is a flexible and less expensive way to get those general education credits done and dusted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, let your instructors know that you intend to transfer to physics bachelors. They could help point you to further resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Get research experiences even as a community college student by applying to National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experiece for Undergraduates (REU) programs. These are typically 8-10 week long research internships that take place in the summer, hosted by universities. Ideslly, they prioritize students who would not get research experience in their home institutions either because their institutions are undergraduate only, don&amp;rsquo;t have faculty performing research in their field of interest. Some community colleges even host their own NSF REUs. Additionally, look out for community college specific research experience programs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are my tips for getting a good start on a physics bachelors at a community college. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. !&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
