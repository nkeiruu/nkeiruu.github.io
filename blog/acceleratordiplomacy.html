        <h1>The latest accelerator-based science projects uniting nations: Particle accelerators and diplomacy through science.</h1>

        <p> The design, construction and operation of large particle accelerator-based facilities have a special place in science diplomacy. 
            They are complex structures that require the expertise and effort of many professionals who are not likely to be in the same country. 
            Novel accelerator related techniques are created and shared between researchers all over the world. 
            One-of-a-kind equipment is finds new life in facilities separated by land and sea (Read till end to see example). On the heels of attending some insightful webinars, 
            I highlight some proposed accelerator-based facilities that push beyond the frontiers of science and national borders.
        </p>

        <h3>In the Balkans, there is growing momentum behind a facility that wants to kindle a new battle – against cancer.</h3>

        <p> During the <a href="https://engage.aps.org/fip/home">APS FIP</a>  webinar entitled “Beating Cancer with SEEIIST while Shaping Science in South-East Europe”, Dr. Sanja Damjanovic 
           (physicist at <a href="https://www.gsi.de/en/about_us" alt="GSI About Us page"> GSI</a> and former Minister of Science for Montenegro)
           , defined science diplomacy as science done by many nations. In the case of SEEIST, 
           these countries are Republic of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of Bulgaria, Kosovo*, Republic of North Macedonia, Montenegro, Republic of Serbia and Republic of Slovenia.
           
        </p>
        <p style = "font-size: small;">* SEEIST notes: ‘This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSC 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence.’</p>
        
        <p id ="purple_hi" style = "width: 80%; text-align: center;">SEEIST: South Eastern Europe International Institute for Sustainable Technology</p>

        <p>
            SEEIST is a regional research infrastructure institute in southeastern Europe. Since 2017, efforts have been made to envision how SEEIST will collectively achieve goals such as scientific excellence, 
            technology transfer, education and fostering peace through science. After some deliberation, the institute decided it will focus on creating a Hadron Cancer Therapy Centre centered on Biomedical Research with protons and heavy ions.
            This accelerator-based facility in its design phase but has already garnered national, EU and <a href="https://seeiist.eu/call-for-the-iaea-fellowship-for-seeiist/"> IAEA</a>  support.
            This project has a lot of promise in promoting international cooperation between countries with thawing relations.
        </p>

        <h3>The proposed international muon collider will require an ever broader effort. </h3>

        <p id = "purple_hi" style = "width: 90%; text-align: center;" > Muons are the heavier siblings of the well-known electron. As I speak, you are probably being 
            showered in muons right now. They are a product of cosmic rays which hit the earth at a rate of 10,000 particles
            per square meter per second (for 1GeV particles).
        </p>

        <p>
            With a lifetime of just 2.2 microseconds, the main scientific challenges of harnessing muons in particle accelerators center around accelerating and colliding them before they disappear. The magnets have to be more powerful and
            the rate at which RF structures accelerate particles have to be higher than ever. However, the challenges would be worth it to achieve record setting collision energies in the 10s of tetra electron-volts (TeV), opening the door to find new physics. On 28 August 2024,
            young researchers gathered virtually to share their research findings and enthusiasm about the muon collider. (https://mucol.web.cern.ch/mucol) The project has brought together countries from UK, Italy, Germany and France. 
            Projects like this continue cooperation between friendly nations, something which should not be taken for granted.

        <h3>Lighting the way for Africa's first light source</h3>

        <p>
            Finally, no conversation about proposed accelerator-based facilities is complete without talking about the African Light Source (AfLS). Envisioned to be first synchrotron on the continent, the inaugural AfLS conference took place in 2015.
            Since then, the team behind the efforts has organized several efforts towards its realization. Schools and conferences train African scientists on synchrotron-based techniques. The AfLS steering committee works to gather political support 
            from national governments and pan African organizations. 
            A major prong of current work is the Conceptual Design Report which will outline site, infrastructure and staff requirements of the future facility. The seventh AfLS conference will take place online and in Johannesburg from 18-23 November 2024.

        <p>
            These projects have reminded me of the uniquely global effort it takes to build research-scale particle accelerators. It is part of the reason why I continue to be fascinated by this field. Even in my own duties, as an accelerator operator,
            I am reminded of this:

            Science diplomacy not only fosters cooperation between countries with otherwise frosty relations, but it also allows nations to achieve goals that could not reach on their own. Particle accelerator-based facilities are usual vehicles for science diplomacy 
            usually due to high infrastructure and human capacity requirements and it is part of the reason why I enjoy the field!
